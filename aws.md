# why we need the virtualization?

1. We have one application which run linux and window but i have only window so how we can run this appliaction on linux
2. want to learn linux system how we can learn i have window systemn

# What is virtualization?

ans: we have my local machine is window so on this window machine we setup the virtualization on this virtualization we add the linux envoiurment

# how this virutalization work?

ans: acutally there we add and setup the hypervisor which is software that create the runs the vistual machine this process is known as a virtualization. we can create multiple virtual machine using this hypervisor there is one example is orcle virtual box which is open souce software we can download it on machine.

# what is hypervisor and how it works?

1. virtual box share the hardware resource from host machine
   we have machine which has 8GM RAM and 100GB HHD now on this we set the hypervisor now we can create the multiple virtual machine using hypervisor this virtual machine share the same resource of the host machine like RAM and HHD and in virtaul machine we need the operating system
   benefits of virtual machine :

   1. we dont need new resource to use diffreent os
   2. no risk of any issue with primary os beacouse every os run own isolated envoirment if any os is down dont effect other os

2. virtual machine are fully isolated
3. every virutal mmachine has separate cpr , ram and storage

# types of hypervisor?

1. type1(bare mental)
2. type2(hoisted)
